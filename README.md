# javascript simulations
Used graphics libraries in javascript to model everyday objects like a ball moving around in a vaccum and also waves propagating out from an impact. Made this into a website and linked the four javascript files files for the waves simulation and also the tried out the script tags for the ball simulation. Waves were made from the eulers formula and used a variety of events to model this. Roles of this project go as follows:
Front end of the project made by Daniel
Ball simulation and javascript expert being Joseph
Wave simulations and math done by Gaurav
